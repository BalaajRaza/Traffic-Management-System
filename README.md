# ðŸš¦ Smart Traffic Management System Simulator

## ðŸ“‘ Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic Management System Simulator** displays a city's traffic management by:

- **Graphs** for traffic network representation.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for vehicle routing.
- **DFS** for vehicle routing.
- **Max-Heap** for congestion management.
- **A*** Algorithm for emergency vehicle routing.

## ðŸš€ Features

### 1. City Traffic Network (Graph Representation)

- Represents intersections and roads with weights indicating travel time or congestion.
- Dynamic addition/removal of roads and intersections.
- Visualizes the traffic network.

### 2. Vehicle Routing System

- Calculates optimal paths using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.
- Recalculates routes dynamically based on real-time traffic changes.
- Tracks vehicle movements across the network.

### 3. Congestion Monitoring

- Tracks vehicle counts using **Max-Heaps**.
- Detects congestion and reroutes traffic using edge congestion levels.
- Visualizes congestion levels.

### 4. Emergency Vehicle Handling

- Clears paths for emergency vehicles.
- Calculates the fastest routes using **A*** Algorithm.
- Restores normal traffic flow post-emergency.

### 5. Accident and Road Closure Simulation

- Simulates road closures and recalculates routes.
- Updates traffic network dynamically.

### 6. Simulation Dashboard

- Provides an interactive interface to visualize the simulation.
- Logs key actions, including vehicle movements and signal changes.
